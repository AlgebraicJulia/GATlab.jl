# GATlab

A collection of tools that one can use to reason with GATs and organize models of GATs.

## Features

- Declaration of GATs
- Multiple inheritance of GATs via pushouts
- Parameterized models of GATs ala Standard ML modules/functors
- E-Graph backed rewriting and type inference in arbitrary GATs
- Backwards compatibility with the Catlab implementation of GATs
