# Plan

1. Refactor E-Graph to also have a context. I don't think we need an extra level
tag for this, because it is always clear what context we are working in.
2. Decide whether to store context with etrms or not.
3. Implement the linear programming extraction.
4. Think about possible lighter-weight extraction procedure.
